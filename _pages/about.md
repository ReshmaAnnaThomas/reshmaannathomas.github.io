I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at ASTRON, the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy, and affiliated with the University of Amsterdam. I work with Prof. dr. Jason Hessels as part of the ASTROFLASH collaboration. My research focuses on detecting fast radio transients, localizing them with sub-arcsecond precision, and studying their properties. I am particularly interested in uncovering their origins and exploring how we can use these signals to probe the Universe. I am currently using data from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) Telescope to do this.
